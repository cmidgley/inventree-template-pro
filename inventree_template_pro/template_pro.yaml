# inventree-template-pro filter configuration file
# 
# filters are used with the Django "filter" tag to filter content according to a set of rules.
# Typically these are named after Part properties, such as "Package Type", to refine an improve
# inconsistencies in naming for reporting / label use.  
filters:
  "_GLOBAL":
    # currently, InvenTree does not handle reporting with chinese characters (they
    # become spaces).  Until that is fixed, this rule removes them
